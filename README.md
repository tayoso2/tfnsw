# Transport for New South Wales Bid

## Project Description

As part of the joint venture bid for TFNSW, he was tasked with generating WLC models for 30+ asset types grouped into 4 major categories (pavements, bridges, corridors and ITS) using Enterprise for Decision Analytics (EDA) for asset deterioration modelling (Probability of Failure). Other approaches were applied in generating Criticality and Probability of Consequence to arrive at asset specific total impact scores which were used as metrics in Universal Visual Optimizer (UVO) to optimize selected programs based on pre-identified scenarios.

The key output was a Qlik dashboard app configured to present the planned investments within the proposed methodologies, a spatial representation of a bush-fire scenario alongside its financial implications and a risk matrix over a 10 year period.

**Pavements**

Modelled using HDM4 Methodology. The Flexible pavements model used in LTC Project was used here.

Modelled using Australian Roads - Guidelines for Bridge Management Documentation. 

Markov chain matrix was applied to Bridges for asset deterioration modelling

**Corridors**

Linear modelling
